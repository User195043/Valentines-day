				U know what is interesting about this? I don't know what is ur favorite chocolate so i bought three of it. I am wondering which one is ur favorite. I also wondering how ur face will look like. Are u surprised or are u gonna be confuse or are u gonna hate it? one thing that i really sure is ur pretty face will still there.
